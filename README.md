Author: My name is Nihad Syed. I am a sophomore at Shakopee High School. 
Programs used: I utilized the languages, HTML, Javascript, CSS, and PHP in order to create a fully functioning and user-friendly website. 
Website Development: This website is for a car dealership that sells cars from many companies and many models corresponding with the company chosen. It's uses databases to store information such as what type of car was taken and the status of it. I started with an HTML template in order to get the structure of the whole website. I took several cues from other people's templates and implemented what I needed for my specific website. I also added a png file image to my Cloud9 folder to use in my HTML. Next, I reused my previous PHP files in order to create a connection to a database. From there, I experimented with many functions necessary for this project, such as a delete option and a read program. I then added a CSS file in order to create the a more user-friendly experience and add color to te website.
